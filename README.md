# bvv2jwkaco
Verify Namespace
To prove the ownership of this Namespace, we require a public repository with the same name that matches its Verification Key(bvv2jwkaco).

For the Namespace io.github.sbd4lz you will need to create the public repository:

https://github.com/sbd4lz/bvv2jwkaco

At the end of the process when your Namespace is registered you can simply delete the repository. It is only needed during the verifying phase.
